#### **Project: The soothing effect of awe**

- **Project Goal**: An empirical study of the soothing effect of awe on both positive and negative emotion.

#### **Project: Awe awakens the authentic self**

- **Project Goal**: Based on small-self theory of awe, authentic-self theory is proposed to further explain the transformative nature of awe.
- **Hypothesis**: Awe activates authentic self via self-transcendence, which motivates pro-sociality out of intrinsic (vs. extrinsic) focus. 
- **Preliminary Results**: Awe enhances the sense of authentic self, via the mediating effect of self-transcendence, and promotes prosociality only when the helping behavior consistent with intrinsic authentic self (vs. inconsistent with intrinsic need).

#### **Project: Nostalgia improves parents’ tradition transfer intention**

- **Project Goal**: Exploring the impact of nostalgia on tradition transfer.
- **Hypothesis**: Nostalgia increased tradition transfer tendency, with self-child overlap playing a moderating role.
